## Quarantine Count

Quarantined candidates: 21. They are excluded from live-progress scoring until quarantine clears.

## Operator Rule

Only candidates with high progress, no gate blockers, and a clear portfolio kill-switch can move to manual review. Real orders still require separate explicit approval and implementation.
